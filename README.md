American football is a sport that quite hasn't garnered the notereity for data analyticsin the way baseball, basketball and soccer have. From what I've gathered it's due to lack of sufficient data (there are 16 games in a regular season, each of these games have less than 100 snaps per game. Compare to baseball with 162 games. Also, from watching Moneyball (great source I know) and reading some articles about football analytics it seems that there might be some push back from individuals within the organization about really diving deep into analyzing the data. When I talk about data analytics in the context of sports I'm discussing more complex models for analyzing the game (I'm guessing there aren't many individuals in the nfl talking about p-values or what the ROC AUC is.

There is some public information about analytics in fantasy football as well (which I will be using for the development of this repository.) For example, gaussian mixture models were used to define rankings for drafting and this has been shown to be successful for drafting

This project attempts to accomplish the following:

* Understand more about the metrics and methodologies done in the analytics and data science communities. We're here to solve problems, and problem solving and learning go hand in hand. 

* Applying these tests, models and metrics to fantasy football data.

* Try to make some money (I'm a grad student who hates cooking.)
